            <h2>About Us</h2>
            <h3>About who you are:</h3>
            <p>My name is Ali Butt. I am doing BS in CS from Georgia State University. I am a senior and hope to graduate in the spring of 2025 and pursue my dream job in the tech field.</p>

            <h3>Project Description and why you choose this project:</h3>
            <p>The Doctors Portal is a comprehensive web application designed to facilitate the management and discovery of healthcare professionals. It serves both medical practitioners and patients by providing an easy-to-use interface for managing doctor information, scheduling, and searching for specialists. I chose this project as I work in a nephrology clinic, so this idea clicked in my mind.</p>

            <h3>Description of technology used for your site:</h3>
            <p>You have all the code, so you know what technologies have been used. Additionally, I used MySQL from phpMyAdmin.</p>

            <h3>What have you learned in this class:</h3>
            <p>I have learned more about getting out of your shell and asking questions, as no question is a stupid question. Making connections is the most important thing in professional life for all types of industries. Talking to recruiters as much as you can and sending them thank you emails after your resume gets accepted is crucial. Additionally, visiting the career services at Park Place has been very beneficial.</p>
